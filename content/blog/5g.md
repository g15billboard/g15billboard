A research report released by Ericsson has provided a perspective on how 5G can be realised in Africa. The Making 5G a reality for Africa report, which was conducted in collaboration with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), reveals that 5G will become the mainstream ecosystem by 2022, and we can expect to see 5G start being deployed by global leading operators during 2019.
